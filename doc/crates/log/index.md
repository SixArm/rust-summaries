# log crate for logging messages

<https://crates.io/crates/log>

The Rust log crate provides a logging framework for Rust programs. The log crate provides a simple interface for logging messages at different levels of severity, such as info, warn, error, and debug.

To use the log crate, you need to first define a logger implementation. This implementation defines how the log messages are recorded and where they are sent. There are many different logger implementations available in the Rust ecosystem, such as simple_logger, env_logger, log4rs, fern, and syslog.

Example file `Cargo.toml` with `log` and `simple_logger`:

```toml
[dependencies]
log = "*"
simple_logger = "*"
```

Example:

```rust
use log::{info, warn, error, debug};
use simple_logger::SimpleLogger;

fn main() {
    SimpleLogger::new().env().init().unwrap();
    info!("Example info message");
    warn!("Example warn message");
    error!("Example error message");
    debug!("Example debug message");
}
```

The log crate also allows you to configure the logging behavior at runtime by setting the log level and enabling or disabling specific loggers. This can be useful for debugging and troubleshooting purposes.

The log crate also provides macros and functions for working with log messages, such as for formatting and recording the runtime file name and line number.
