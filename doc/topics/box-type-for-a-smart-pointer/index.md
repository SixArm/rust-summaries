# Box type for a smart pointer

In Rust, a `Box` is a smart pointer that provides a way to allocate memory on the heap and move data into that memory.

`Box` will allocate an object at runtime rather than at compile time. When a value is wrapped in a `Box`, it is moved to the heap and the `Box` itself is stored on the stack. This allows you to allocate a large object on the heap without having to worry about stack size limitations. When a `Box` goes out of scope, the memory it allocated is automatically deallocated. This eliminates the need to manually manage memory and helps prevent common memory-related bugs such as memory leaks and dangling pointers.

Another benefit of `Box` is that it enables ownership transfer. When you move a value into a `Box`, you transfer ownership of the value to the `Box`. This means that the `Box` becomes the owner of the value and is responsible for cleaning it up when it goes out of scope. This can be useful when you need to transfer ownership of a value between different parts of your program.


## Usage

To use `Box`, you can create a new instance by calling the `Box::new` function and passing in the value you want to allocate on the heap. For example, to allocate a new `i32` value on the heap and store it in a `Box`:

```rust
let my_box = Box::new(42);
```

This creates a new `Box` that contains the value 42. When `my_box` goes out of scope, the memory it allocated will be automatically deallocated.

Overall, `Box` is a useful tool for allocating objects on the heap, transferring ownership between parts of your program, and using automatic deallocation to help prevent memory-related bugs.
