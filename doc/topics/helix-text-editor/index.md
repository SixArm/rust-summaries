# Helix text editor

<https://helix-editor.com/>

Helix is terminal-based text editor written in Rust, with excellent capabilities for programming in Rust. Helix is inspired by Neovim and Kakoune, and is similar in ways to vim, emacs, and nano.

Key benefits:

* Multiple selections as a core editing primitive, so commands can manipulate selections, which allows concurrent code editing.

* Tree-sitter integration, which enables better syntax highlighting, indent calculation, and code navigation.

* Powerful code manipulation to navigate and select functions, classes, comments, etc and select syntax tree nodes instead of plain text.

* Language server support provides language-specific auto completion, goto definition, documentation, diagnostics and other IDE features with no additional configuration.

* Built in Rust, for the terminal. No Electron. No VimScript. No JavaScript. Use it over ssh, tmux, or a plain terminal. Your laptop battery life will thank you.

* Modern features such as fuzzy finder to jump to files and symbols, project wide search, beautiful themes, auto closing bracket pairs, surround integration and more.
