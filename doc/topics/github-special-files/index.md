# GitHub special files

<https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/github-special-files-and-paths>

GitHub uses various special files and file names in order to provide special capabilities, such as the file `README` for the front page of a repository, and `LICENSE` for the automatic linking of a legal notice.

Most of these files can be named various ways, such as `README` for plain text, `README.md` for Markdown, `README.asc` for ASCII Doc, etc.

Here are some of the special files we use in our projects:

`README`: Introduce your project, why it is useful, what it does, etc.

`CHANGELOG`: List project changes, such as versions, new features, etc.

`LICENSE`: State the project's license, copyright, legal aspects, etc.

`SUPPORT`: Advise readers how they can get help with the project.

`SECURITY`: Detail the project's security policies, disclosure process, etc.

`CONTRIBUTING`: Encourage people to contribute to the project.

`CODE_OF_CONDUCT`: Set your community expectations and practices.

`CITATION.cff`: How should people to cite the project?

`ISSUE_TEMPLATE`: Customize what a user sees for a new issue.

`PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE`: Customize what a user sees for a new PR.

`CODEOWNERS`: Configure who gets automatically requested for reviews.

`AUTHORS`: List people who are significant authors of the project.

`CONTRIBUTORS`: List all people who have contributed to the project.

`ACKNOWLEDGMENTS`: Highlight related works, dependencies, thanks, etc.
